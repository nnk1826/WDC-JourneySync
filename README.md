# JourneySync: Travel Planner
JourneySync is a comprehensive web application developed as a university
project to streamline travel planning. It offers a centralized platform
for users to customize, manage, and visualize their trips with ease.
Designed for solo travelers, families, group adventurers, and digital
nomads, the app simplifies the journey from trip ideation to final
itinerary management.
## Project Description

personalized itineraries, and secure bookings â€” all in one place.
Key highlights:
- Real-time hotel data and images via Amadeus and Google Maps APIs
- Interactive itineraries with map visualization (Google Maps API)
- Custom database to store user data, preferences, and bookings
- Admin dashboard for content moderation, analytics, and user management
